  -for each CBD census block
    -expand radius (keep track of total area) (at some increment)
    -each time new block within radius
      -add population of that block to counter
      -check new density (pop/area above threshold d)
      -continue 
      -if density dips below d
        -keep track of CBD census start block and final population achieved
  -compare all CBD start points and pick highest one
